        <h4>What is Setga Guide? </h4>

        <p>Setga Guide (Search, Travel, Gala Guide) intends to connect the travellers to the
             best destinations within the Philippines; providing them such resources which 
             aims to help them to choose travel destinations online. 
        </p>
        <p>Setga Guide also aims to reshape the manner in which explorers discover data, 
            plan an outing, diary and offer their movement encounters. In light of dependable data, 
            appraisals and audits made by and for travellers, you approach reliable travel administrations and experiences.  
       </p>
       <br>
       <h4>Our Vision</h4>
       <p>Envision a network committed to the universe of movement and the travel industry. A spot where you can find out about untainted areas that energize and move you and having the option to associate with the individuals who can share their own encounters direct. A spot where travel and experience drive the discussion, and a stage that rewards you for adding to a network that needs to be propelled by the tales you need to share. This is our vision for Setga Guide, a progressive social stage for the movement and the travel industry. An innovation set to turn into a tremendously troublesome power in a multi-trillion dollar worldwide industry by dispensing with expensive center men, and setting all that you have to make an incredible excursion into a carefully structured versatile enhanced Experience.
   </p>
   <p>An across the board social stage made with the sole aim of reshaping how you plan, book and record your excursions on the web, and a dream that stands prepared for you to investigate.  
</p>
<br>
<h4>Today's Landscape </h4>
        
        <p>The movement and the travel industry is in a condition of transition. As internet booking stages, web based life, and the audit economy wander, individuals are requesting definitely more from their excursions than those that went before them could possibly do. 
        </p>
        <p>In the present current scene, there is no devoted stage where those keen on movement and the travel industry can associate in a genuinely significant manner. A stage that is exclusively intended to support the developing interest for movement centered substance such that both engages and illuminates.  
       </p>
       <p>In the present divided web based life scene we see content from movement influencers dispersed over the social web making it troublesome, and tedious for individuals to discover. 
   </p>
   <p>
    What's more, we have a bunch of agents, as Tripadvisor and Booking.com merrily cutting out their cut of a $7.6 trillion industry without genuinely giving a bound together client experience that puts the needs and needs of the client at the core of all that they do.
